# Gathering-and-Cleaning-Data-Project

##Overview
In this project we collect, work with and clean a data set. We create an R script to generate a tidy data that can be use for later analysis. The data we used can be found here at: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

##Summary
Create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

1)Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2)Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3)Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4)Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

5)From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The Repository should also contain:

1)The R script run_analysis containing all the information

2)A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md.

3)A README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

4)A link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis
